# roll-a-ball-swift
Unity's Roll-A-Ball tutorial implemented in Swift

## Requirements:
- Unity 5.4.0f3 to run the project
- RemObjects Fire 8.4.96.2033 (beta) to modify source and game logic DLL

## Overview
The project leverages Unity's support for [managed plugins](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingDLL.html).
This allows usage of DLLs generated by external compilers. To create a DLL,
the project uses the RemObjects [Elements compiler](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/default.aspx)
and their Swift implementation, [Silver](http://www.elementscompiler.com/elements/silver/).

Since `Assets/Plugins/GameLogic.dll` is provided in the repo, you should be able to just run
the Unity project as is. I only tested on macOS and iOS however. For iOS, the
game builds but there is no touch input implemented.

In addition to the standard Unity project directories, the **GameLogicSolution**
solution includes **GameLogic** and **UnityAspect** projects.

## GameLogic Project
The GameLogic project implements the game logic. Similar to
[Roll-a-ball-FSharp](https://github.com/Thorium/Roll-a-ball-FSharp),
the source is a direct translation of the tutorial's C# to Swift. Also, the
source is in one file since it's so trivial.

## UnityAspect Project
The UnityAspect project uses Element's support for
[Aspects](https://docs.elementscompiler.com/Concepts/Aspects/Cirrus/). It
exposes an attribute that will publicize a Swift class property's underlying
field for the Unity editor. This is necessary because Swift properties translate
to properties, but Unity editor seems to work with serialized *fields*. In order
to edit a property in the Unity editor, you will need to add the
`@UnityAspect.PublicizeField` attribute to it.

## Caveats
RemObjects provides an optional
[Swift Base Library](https://docs.elementscompiler.com/API/SwiftBaseLibrary/).

> It provides some of the core types, classes and functions that, while not part
> of the Swift language spec per se, are commonly used in Swift apps (and
> provided in a similar Swift Base Library in Apple's implementation).

Unfortunately, it requires [.NET 4.0](https://talk.remobjects.com/t/swift-library-net-version-requirements/8370)
which Unity does not use.
